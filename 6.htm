<p><strong>Scientific name:</strong> <em>Phymateus viridipes</em></p>

<p><strong>Distribution: </strong>Southern Africa</p>

<p><strong>Size:</strong> 70 mm (2.75 inches) long</p>

<p>This large African grasshopper secretes a noxious fluid from the thorax when alarmed. The fluid is derived from the poisonous milkweed plants upon which it feeds as an immature nymph or adult. The colored hind wings, which are normally hidden when the grasshopper is at rest, can also be flashed to deter potential predators.</p>
