<p><strong>Scientific name: </strong><em>Mormolyce phyllodes</em></p>

<p><strong>Distribution: </strong>Indo-Malaya</p>

<p><strong>Size:</strong> 60 to 100 mm (2.5 to 4 inches) long</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most unusual beetle in the hugely diverse Carabidae family of ground beetles. The shape of its body has been compared to a guitar or violin, and if viewed side on, appears to be completely flat.</p>

<p><em>M. phyllodes</em> is perfectly suited for life under the loose bark of dead trees or in soil cracks. If disturbed, it will emit a spray of liquid from the tip of its abdomen. The fluid has a strong scent, resembling a mixture of nitric acid and ammonia, and causes a burning sensation if sprayed into the eyes.</p>
