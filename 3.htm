<p><strong>Scientific name: </strong><em>Stigmodera cancellata</em></p>

<p><strong>Distribution: </strong>Western Australia</p>

<p><strong>Size: </strong>23 to 35 mm (1 to 1.5 inches) long</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">This beautiful beetle is endemic to coastal Western Australia, where larvae live in soil and feed on the roots of myrtle shrubs for up to 15 years. Adults emerge with perfect timing to coincide with the wildflower season: October to November. </span>Females are significantly larger than the males.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The species</span>’ h<span style="font-size: 1em;">ardened fore wings, or elytra, are greenish or bluish with six irregular red spots and red lateral margins; these protective sheaths are </span>coarsely punctured, giving the beetle a shimmery, bespeckled appearance.<span style="font-size: 1em;"> </span><em>S. cancellata</em>’s<span style="font-size: 1em;"> forebody is green, coppery or blackish. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Huertas likens beetles</span>’ “strong bodies” to armored tanks. Still, she says, a set of delicate wings beneath these insects’ robust wings enables them to fly as efficiently as any other bug species.</p>
