<p><strong>Scientific name: </strong><em>Agrias claudina</em></p>

<p><strong>Distribution: </strong>Tropical South America</p>

<p><strong>Size:</strong> 80 mm (3.25 inch) wingspan</p>

<p>The Claudina butterfly entranced British explorer and scientist <a href="https://www.linnean.org/the-society/linnean-future/henry-walter-bates">Henry Walter Bates</a> when he encountered it in the Brazilian Amazon during the 1850s.</p>

<p>This rainforest butterfly has vivid crimson patches on its upper wings, but its underwings are arguably even more spectacular. It does, however, have some unsavory feeding habits—namely, sucking up nutrients from rotting flesh and fruit.</p>

<p>The Claudina butterfly’s underwings are intricately patterned. Its hind wing boasts yellow tufts called the <a href="https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/androconia">androconia</a>. These special scales, found on many male members of the insect order Lepidoptera, diffuse pheromenes involved in courtship.</p>

<p>“The visible bright colouration in the wings of many butterflies is essential for long-distance communication and it has evolved through advantage to males,” says Huertas. “In some cases, strong coloration is used by some species of butterflies to defer predators. The perception of the colors varies so much between species that it may offer an explanation for the different range of behaviors among them.”</p>
