<p><strong>Scientific name: </strong><em>Baorisa hieroglyphica</em></p>

<p><strong>Distribution: </strong>Northern India, Southeast Asia</p>

<p><strong>Size: </strong>50 mm (2 inch) wingspan</p>

<p>The species name <em>hieroglyphica </em>refers to the striking geometric lines and shapes on this moth’s fore wings. Perhaps the shapes resemble a red insect head with antennae and legs, directing a bird’s bill toward the wingtips? Or a spider on its web? Although sometimes referred to as the <a href="https://www.pablopicasso.org/">Picasso</a> moth, you might think Miro moth—a nod to Spanish painter <a href="https://www.theartstory.org/artist/miro-joan/">Joan Miró</a>’s colorful creations—is more appropriate.</p>
